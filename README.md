# Remote-Sliding-Gate
This Arduino project introduces an innovative solution for controlling a sliding gate at home using remote access. By leveraging Arduino microcontrollers and wireless remote technology, this project allows users to conveniently open and close their home gate with the push of a button.

Features:
    Remote Control Access: Use a wireless remote to open and close the sliding gate from a distance.
    Customizable Operation: Adjust the gate's opening and closing parameters to suit your preferences and gate size.
    Safety Measures: It has a laser system to detect any thing pass through the gate
    Low Power Consumption: Optimize power usage to prolong battery life and reduce energy consumption.
    Easy Installation: Simple installation process suitable for DIY enthusiasts with basic electronics knowledge.

Technologies Used:
    Arduino uno: Power the control system and manage gate operation.
    Wireless Remote Technology (433Mhz remote and receiver): Enable remote control access for gate operation from a distance.
    Obstacle Detection Sensors (laser system): Ensure safety by detecting obstacles in the gate's path during operation.
    Motor (12v scouter starting mortor): Interface with the sliding gate motor to control its movement accurately and that motor has a high torque which suits for this.
    12v 10A smps(Power supply):to power up the motor.
